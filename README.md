## A little about me!

My name is Grant Powell, I'm a software engineer out of the University of Tennessee. I worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the summer of 2015 in the Computational Science and Engineering Division. While at Oak Ridge I wrote software as part of the Department of Energy's
Smart Snow Removal Project that speed up processing from 132 hours to less than 3 for the city of Knoxville. Last summer,  I was a software engineering intern in the FedEx Technical Architecture Division. My FedEx intern team and I became the first ever win the highest intern award twice in a row. 

My passion is building software that helps people. I’m on the executive board of my fraternity, and while on the board I built an attendance web app that keeps track of attendance through QR scans on snapchat. The attendance system has been used at over 50 events with over 2000 sign-ins and is well received by brothers. I’m looking forward in my career to building more awesome software that helps people accomplish their goals.
